 * XPLProParkingBrakeDemo
 * This example will light up a properly installed LED on a specified arduino pin, or you could use the built-in LED 
 * usually on pin 13.
 * 
 * Created by Curiosity Workshop for XPL/Pro arduino->XPlane system.
 * 
 * This sketch was developed and tested on an Arduino Mega in response to a user request.
