 * XPLProShutdownExample
 *
 * This examples turns on the built in LED while Xplane is active with a plane loaded and off when the plane is unloaded
 *  or if Xplane shuts down
 * 
 * Created by Curiosity Workshop for XPL/Pro arduino->XPlane system.
 * 
 * This sketch was developed and tested on an Arduino Mega.
